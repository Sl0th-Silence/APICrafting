This is a working project of an API made with Node.js and Express. Eventually this project will be using EJS pages and populating them with data from a database.

To Do!
- Create the basics of the site. Pages, etc.
- Create the python script to scrape the house listing site and put it in a database
- Pull from the database, into the site and list houses on the listing pages
- Get a single page listing like we did in Ziads class
- Cry and contemplate your life choices
- Drink coffee
- Check out bootstrap for testing the site publicly
